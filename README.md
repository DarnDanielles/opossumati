#Functionality
NQuiry is a survey webapp which allows users to create an account in order to create and distribute surveys. From their dashboard, users can create, edit, and publish surveys and, eventually, check the results of surveys submitted. 

Surveys support three different question types from long and short questions to yes or no questions. Users can add as many questions as they desire from the survey creator. After creating a survey, users can publish the survey to see a view of the survey as others taking it will see it as well as receive a URL to distribute the survey. 

Access to user surveys and survey results is protected and restricted to the owner, so users can rest assured that their privacy and data is protected.
